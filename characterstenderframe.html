								<b>Species:</b> Ladybug
								<br><b>Likes:</b> Red velvet cake, acoustic music, graphic novels
								<p>The main character of the story, as well as the Cocoon Program's newest recruit.</p>
								<p>An aspiring artist turned soldier after a chance encounter during one of her research walks. Despite being green, she makes up for her weaknesses in spades with an unrivaled intuition.</p>
								<p>Despite this, her nerves often get the best of her, as well as her lack of confidence and self-esteem.</p>

								<b>Species:</b> Wasp
								<br><b>Likes:</b> Gummy sour candies, hard rock, decorating her Tender Frame (with flames)
								<p>The hot-headed lancer, and Two-spot's childhood friend.</p>
								<p>Though she puts up a front of vanity and arrogance, oftentimes she's actually more tense than Two-spot when out on missions.<p>
								<p>It is unknown if she genuinely believes the flames painted on her Tender Frame make it go faster or not.</p>

								<b>Species:</b> Mantis
								<br><b>Likes:</b> Honey graham gelato, decorating her Tender Frame (with flowers), mysteries
								<p>A moral compass to the group, often trying to cheer up and motivate those around her.</p>
								<p>Her elegance and decorum gives her a graceful flow not unlike that of a dancer when in combat.</p>
								<p>Oftentimes she'll stay up late, completely enamored in stories both fictional and nonfictional. Vespari, her bunkmate, often has to wake her up as a result.</p>

								<b>Species:</b> Beetle
								<br><b>Likes:</b> Caramel-coated cheesecake, maintenance work, romance novels and erotica
								<p>The mechanic and stalwart tank of the group.</p>
								<p>Quiet and to-the-point, her lack of conversationality often leads to awkward situations with her peers.</p>
								<p>Still, one could easily spend hours with her if the topic in question is one in alignment with her many passions.</p>

								<b>Species:</b> Caterpillar
								<br><b>Likes:</b> Dark chocolate protein bars, EDM/Trance, quiet moments to herself
								<p>A child soldier, who often keeps to herself rather than spending time amongst her peers.</p>
								<p>She isn't antisocial by choice-- she just doesn't know how to connect with others. She often spends time with her Tender Frame's AI, known as MORPHO.</p>
								<p>Her skills as a sniper are unparalleled, shutting out all background noise as she gets into a machine-like autopilot state.</p>
